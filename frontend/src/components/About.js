              <h2>About Wind Energy Prediction</h2>
              <p>
                Wind energy prediction involves forecasting the amount of energy that can be generated by wind turbines
                based on various factors such as wind speed, direction, and turbine efficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                This method of prediction helps in optimizing the use of wind energy resources and making informed
                decisions in the renewable energy sector.
              </p>
              <p>
                Renewable energy, including wind power, is crucial in reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating
                climate change. It is a sustainable and clean source of energy with minimal environmental impact.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wind turbines capture kinetic energy from the wind and convert it into electricity. The efficiency of
                this process depends on various factors such as the design of the turbine blades, wind speed, and
                environmental conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The integration of wind energy into the power grid requires accurate prediction models to ensure a
                stable and reliable energy supply, contributing to a more sustainable future.
