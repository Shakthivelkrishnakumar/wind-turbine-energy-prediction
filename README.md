Post-training evaluation underscored the model's impressive accuracy, revealing a commendable performance level of 86% in predicting wind turbine energy output.

Linear Regression:
Definition: Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (often denoted as 'Y') and one or more independent variables (denoted as 'X') by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
Line Equation: The linear regression equation takes the form: Y=b0+b1X+ε, where:
	Y represents the dependent variable being predicted.
	X denotes the independent variable(s).
	b0  is the intercept (the value of Y when X is zero).
	b1  is the slope (the change in Y for a unit change in X).
	ε represents the error term accounting for unexplained variability in Y.

Purpose: 
Linear regression aims to understand and quantify the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. It helps in predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variable(s).
Assumptions:
Linearity: 
•	The relationship between X and Y should be linear.
Independence: Observations should be independent of each other.
Homoscedasticity: 
•	The variance of the residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) should remain constant across all levels of X.
Normality: 
•	Residuals should follow a normal distribution.
Training the Model: 
•	In linear regression, the model is trained by finding the optimal values of b0  and b1  that minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values of Y.
Evaluation: 
•	The model's performance is often evaluated using metrics like R-squared (coefficient of determination), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess how well the model fits the observed data.
Use Cases:
•	 Linear regression finds application in various fields, including economics (predicting sales based on advertising expenditure), finance (stock price prediction), and science (relationship between variables like temperature and humidity).
Extensions:
•	 While simple linear regression involves one independent variable, multiple linear regression incorporates multiple predictors to model the relationship between Y and multiple X variables.
Limitations: 
•	Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between variables, and its effectiveness can be limited if the relationship is non-linear. It can also be sensitive to outliers.
Interpretation: 
•	The coefficients (b0  and b1 ) offer insights into the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables. For instance, a positive b1 suggests a positive correlation between X and Y, while a negative b1 implies an inverse relationship.

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the project adeptly addressed the intricate challenge of forecasting wind turbine energy production by leveraging advanced analytical techniques and integrating real-time weather data. Achieving an accuracy of 86% emphasizes the model's reliability, thereby contributing significantly to informed decision-making in wind-based energy generation and resource utilization.
